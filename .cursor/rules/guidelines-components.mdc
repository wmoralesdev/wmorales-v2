# Component Best Practices

## Component Design

- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility principle).
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Avoid prop drilling; use context or state management if needed.
- Write clear, concise, and self-documenting code.
- Ensure accessibility (a11y) for all interactive elements.

## Client vs Server Components

- Default to server components for better performance.
- Use `use client` only when needed for:
  - Browser-only APIs (localStorage, window, etc.)
  - React hooks that require client state (useState, useEffect, etc.)
  - Event handlers and interactivity
- Never add `use client` at the page level; create separate client components instead.

## Testing

- Write unit and integration tests for critical logic and components.
- Test accessibility features and keyboard navigation.
