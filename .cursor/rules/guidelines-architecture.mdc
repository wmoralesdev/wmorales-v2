# Architecture & Guidelines

## Strict Requirements

- **Framework:** Must use Next.js 15 or newer. Code or patterns from older Next.js versions (e.g., pages directory, legacy data fetching) are not allowed.
- **Authentication:** Use Supabase for authentication. Only Google and Github providers are permitted.
- **Language:** All code must be written in TypeScript. No JavaScript files allowed.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. No CSS modules, SCSS, or inline styles.
- **UI Components:** Use shadcn/ui for all UI primitives and components. Custom components must follow shadcn/ui conventions.
- **Dark Mode:** The site must support dark mode using Tailwind's dark variant and shadcn/ui theming, no light mode should be generated.

## Project Structure

Consider the following from the root directory:
- Use the `/app` directory for all routes and layouts (Next.js 13+ app router).
- Place shared components in `/components`.
- Place hooks in `/hooks`.
- Place utility functions in `/lib`.
- Use `/public` for static assets.

## Authentication (Supabase)

- Configure Supabase client securely using environment variables.
- Only Google and Github OAuth providers are allowed.
- Protect routes/pages that require authentication using Supabase session checks.
- Do not expose Supabase service keys on the client.

## TypeScript

- All files must use `.ts` or `.tsx` extensions.
- Enable `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json`.
- Use explicit types for all function parameters and return values.
- Avoid use of `any`. Use `unknown` and type guards if necessary.
- Prefer type aliases and interfaces for data structures.

## Tailwind CSS

- Use utility classes for all styling.
- Do not use custom CSS except for global resets or variables in `globals.css`.
- Use Tailwind's `dark:` variant for dark mode support.
- Extend the theme in `tailwind.config.js` for custom colors, fonts, or spacing.
- Use semantic class names for custom utilities.

## shadcn/ui

- Use shadcn/ui components for all UI primitives (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.).
- Customize shadcn/ui components via props and Tailwind classes, not by editing library code.
- Follow shadcn/ui accessibility and keyboard navigation best practices.
- Use shadcn/ui theming for consistent light/dark mode.

## Next.js 15+

- Use the `/app` directory and server components by default.
- Use `use client` only when strictly necessary (e.g., for hooks that require client-side state).
  - Neve use `use client` at `page.tsx` level, move the client logic to its own component file.
- Use `fetch`, `cache`, and `revalidate` for data fetching as per Next.js 15 standards.
- Use `metadata` export for SEO and social sharing.
- Use `next/font` for font loading.
- Do not use deprecated APIs (e.g., `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`).

## Dark Mode

- Implement dark mode as default, do not use directly `dark:` directive. There is no other theme or mode, just the dark one.

## General Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility principle).
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Avoid prop drilling; use context or state management if needed.
- Write clear, concise, and self-documenting code.
- Use descriptive names for files, variables, and functions.
- Document complex logic with comments and JSDoc where appropriate.
- Ensure accessibility (a11y) for all interactive elements.
- Write unit and integration tests for critical logic and components.

## Code Conventions

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use single quotes for strings, except in JSX where double quotes are preferred.
- Use trailing commas in multiline objects and arrays.
- Prefer arrow functions for component definitions.
- Group imports: external libraries, then internal modules, then styles.
- Sort imports alphabetically within groups.
- Use ES modules (`import`/`export`).
- No console logs in production code.

## Linting & Formatting

- Use ESLint with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind plugins.
- Use Prettier for code formatting.
- Fix all lint and type errors before merging code.

## Commit & PR Guidelines

- Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat(auth): add Google login with Supabase`).
- Write clear, descriptive PR titles and descriptions.
- Reference related issues or tasks in PRs.

Adhering to these guidelines is mandatory. Any deviation must be justified and approved in code review.
