# Code Style & Conventions

## Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use single quotes for strings, except in JSX where double quotes are preferred.
- Use trailing commas in multiline objects and arrays.
- Prefer arrow functions for component definitions.

## Code Quality

- Document complex logic with comments and JSDoc where appropriate.
- No console logs in production code.
- Fix all lint and type errors before merging code.

## Linting & Formatting Tools

- Use ESLint with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind plugins.
- Use Prettier for code formatting.
- Use Biome for fast linting and formatting (if configured).
