Welcome to my corner of the internet. This blog is where I'll share thoughts on software engineering, web development, and the technologies I work with daily.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- Modern web development with **React** and **Next.js**
- Backend architectures and database design
- Developer experience and tooling
- Random thoughts on tech and life

## Why blog?

Writing helps me think through problems more clearly. If something I share here helps someone else along the way, that's a bonus.

Stay tuned for more.
