# Luma event description guidelines

How we write event descriptions for Luma.

## Voice & tone

Cursor speaks with quiet confidence: clear, concise, and approachable. Technical when needed, light when possible. Always professional, sometimes witty, never forced.

**Do**: Say things simply and directly. Be clear and concise, but complete.

**Don't**: Oversell or exaggerate. Don't try too hard to be funny. Don't hide meaning in jargon.

## Spanish writing rules

- **Sentence case**: capitalize only the first word and proper nouns (Cursor, React, Supabase, San Salvador, UFG, Next.js).
- **Use commas, not em dashes**: prefer commas for clauses instead of em dashes (—).
- Short sentences with active voice and concrete verbs.
- Avoid hype, filler words, and corporate jargon.

## Standard structure

1. **Intro** (1–2 paragraphs): What the event is and what participants will accomplish.
2. **Qué vas a construir**: Specific deliverables or projects.
3. **Para quién es**: Target audience and skill level.
4. **Requisitos**: Tools, accounts, or setup needed.
5. **Agenda**: High-level schedule.
6. **Fecha y hora**: Use "hora por confirmar" if TBD.
7. **Ubicación**: Full address with building name if relevant.
8. **Notas**: Capacity, what to bring, accessibility info.
