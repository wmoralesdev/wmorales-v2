# Getting ready for Cursor hackathon San Salvador 2026

This post is a short, practical checklist so you can arrive ready to build. The main goal is simple: **create the accounts you’ll need, install Cursor, and prepare your environment before the event**.

{% callout type="info" title="If you want a step-by-step environment guide" %}
Start here: [Start building web apps today (no technical background needed)](/blog/dev-environment-setup). It walks through installing Cursor, Node.js, Git, and the basics.

## How a hackathon works (quick version)

A hackathon is a short, intense “build sprint” where teams turn an idea into a prototype and then demo it.

Typical flow:

- **Kickoff**: theme/rules, team formation, quick ideation
- **Build time**: research, design, implementation, testing, iteration
- **Demo**: you show what you built and why it matters
- **Judging**: evaluators score projects against a rubric

Good hackathons reward **clarity, teamwork, and learning**. A production-ready product is not required (and usually not the point).

## Your pre-hackathon checklist (do this at home)

{% card title="Do this first" variant="feature" %}
1. **Create a Cursor account** at [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) and make sure you can sign in.
2. **Install Cursor** on your laptop and open it at least once.
3. **Log in inside Cursor** (so you don’t lose time on Wi‑Fi/auth issues at the venue).
4. **Create a GitHub account** (or confirm you can log in), since many teams will use GitHub to share code.
5. **Update your system** (OS updates, browser updates) and restart your laptop the day before.
{% /card %}

{% callout type="tip" title="If you’re not a programmer" %}
Still do the checklist. You can use Cursor for writing your pitch, user stories, UI copy, and documentation. Your contribution matters.
{% /callout %}

### Prepare your build environment (choose what fits your project)

You don’t need everything. Pick the option closest to what your team plans to build.

{% card title="Option A: Web app (most common)" variant="default" %}
- Install **Node.js LTS** (recommended via NVM).
- Install **Git**.
- Make sure you can run `node -v`, `npm -v`, and `git --version` in a terminal.
{% /card %}

{% card title="Option B: Mobile app (Expo / React Native)" variant="default" %}
- Install **Node.js LTS**.
- Install the **Expo** tooling (your team can decide between Expo Go vs. native builds).
- If you plan to build native: install **Android Studio** and/or **Xcode** ahead of time (these downloads are big).
{% /card %}

{% card title="Option C: Data / automation / scripting" variant="default" %}
- Install **Python 3** (and confirm `python --version` or `python3 --version` works).
- Install **Git**.
{% /card %}

{% card title="Option D: Design / research / storytelling" variant="default" %}
- Have **Figma** access (or your preferred design tool).
- Bring a notes tool (Notion/Google Docs) for requirements and the demo script.
{% /card %}

{% callout type="warning" title="Avoid day-of installs" %}
Big downloads (Xcode, Android Studio, Docker) can burn hours during a hackathon. If you might need them, install them the day before.
{% /callout %}

## Plan your product requirements (fast, but real)

The best hackathon teams don’t “build features.” They build **a clear solution to a specific problem**.

Use this lightweight structure:

- **Problem**: what pain exists and for whom?
- **Target user**: who is this for (be specific)?
- **Proposed solution**: what are you building?
- **Must-haves**: the smallest set needed for a demo
- **Nice-to-haves**: only if time allows
- **Non-goals**: what you are intentionally not doing
- **Demo story**: what will you show in 2–3 minutes?

{% cursor-prompt title="Prompt: Define requirements and a demo plan" prompt="We are participating in Cursor Hackathon San Salvador 2026. Help our team create a simple, clear product spec and demo plan.

Context:
- Team skills (technical + non-technical): [fill in]
- Time available: [fill in]
- Idea in one sentence: [fill in]

Please produce:
1) Problem statement (who, what pain, why now)
2) Target user + 2-3 key user stories (plain language)
3) Success criteria for the demo (what must work during the presentation)
4) Must-haves vs. nice-to-haves vs. non-goals
5) Risks/unknowns + quick experiments to de-risk them
6) A 2-3 minute demo script outline (hook → problem → solution → live demo → next steps)

Keep it short, and prioritize clarity over completeness." /%}

## Use Cursor effectively during the hackathon

Cursor is most powerful when you treat it like a teammate that helps you plan, execute, and iterate.

{% card title="High-leverage habits" variant="success" %}
- **Start in plan mode**: ask for a plan before writing code, then execute the plan in small chunks.
- **Keep context small and focused**: one task per prompt (feature, bug, refactor, doc).
- **Ask for tradeoffs**: “fastest approach vs. cleanest approach” to match hackathon time.
- **Commit early and often**: small commits make it easier to collaborate and recover.
- **Write the demo script early**: it forces a realistic scope and highlights missing pieces.
{% /card %}

{% cursor-prompt title="Prompt: Split work into tasks for the team" prompt="We have a hackathon project with both technical and non-technical teammates.

Here is our idea and must-haves: [paste]

Please:
1) Break the work into 8-15 small tasks (each 30-90 minutes)
2) Label each task as: engineering, design, research, copywriting, or demo
3) Identify dependencies
4) Suggest an order of execution that maximizes our chance of having a solid demo

Output as a simple checklist." /%}

## A judging rubric that works for mixed teams

Not everyone is a programmer, and a hackathon is not a production launch. Judges should prioritize impact and learning over “how complete” the code is.

Suggested criteria:

- **Problem clarity and user empathy**: is the problem real, specific, and well understood?
- **Solution fit**: does the prototype actually address the problem for the target user?
- **Creativity and originality**: is there a fresh angle, insight, or clever approach?
- **Collaboration and roles**: did the team divide work well, including non-technical contributions?
- **Iteration and learning**: did the team test assumptions, adapt, and improve during the event?
- **Demo and storytelling**: is the demo clear, honest, and easy to follow for a general audience?
- **Feasibility and next steps**: can you explain what would be needed to make it real after the hackathon?
- **Accessibility and inclusion**: does the solution consider different users and constraints?
- **Responsible tool use**: if AI was used, is it used thoughtfully and transparently?

{% callout type="success" title="A great demo beats a big scope" %}
If your demo tells a clear story and your prototype supports it, you’re doing hackathons the right way.

## Last-minute “don’t forget” list

- Laptop charger (and a backup if you have one)
- Headphones (for focused work)
- A short team intro (who you are, what each person is doing)
- A link you can share fast (GitHub repo, slides, or a short doc)
