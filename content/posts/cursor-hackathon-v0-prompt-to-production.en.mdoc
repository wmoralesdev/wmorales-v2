# Weekend Recap: Cursor Hackathon + v0 Prompt to Production

This weekend I led and organized two back-to-back community events:

- **Cursor Hackathon** — _[CITY / VENUE]_ — _[DATE + TIME]_
- **v0: Prompt to Production** — _[CITY / VENUE]_ — _[DATE + TIME]_

If you were there, thank you for showing up with curiosity and good energy. If you missed it, here’s a behind-the-scenes look at what we built, what worked, what I’d change next time, and a playbook you can reuse.

## Quick summary (copy/paste)

{% card title="TL;DR" description="Replace the bracketed placeholders with real numbers." variant="feature" %}
- **Attendees**: ~[X]
- **Teams / projects**: [X]
- **Demos shipped**: [X]
- **Stack themes**: [ex: Next.js, Supabase, v0, Cursor Agents]
- **Biggest learning**: [one sentence]
{% /card %}

## Why we ran these events

I wanted to create a space where people could:

- learn **how to build faster** with AI tools (without sacrificing craft)
- go from **prompt → prototype → production** in one sitting
- meet other builders and ship something real (even if imperfect)

If I had to describe the goal in one line:

> _Help people leave the room with momentum._

## Event 1: Cursor Hackathon

### Format

- **Duration**: _[X hours]_
- **Theme / constraints**: _[optional theme, ex: “Build something you can demo in 3 minutes”]_
- **Teams**: _[solo / teams of X]_
- **Judging**: _[criteria: impact, execution, creativity, demo]_

### Agenda (template)

- **00:00–00:15** Welcome + rules + how to ship a demo
- **00:15–00:30** Team formation + idea pitches
- **00:30–02:30** Build time + mentor rounds
- **02:30–03:15** Demos
- **03:15–03:30** Winners + shout-outs + wrap

### What people built (demo list)

Replace this section with the actual projects, links, and one-line summaries:

- **[Project name]** — _[1 sentence]_ — `TODO_LINK`
- **[Project name]** — _[1 sentence]_ — `TODO_LINK`
- **[Project name]** — _[1 sentence]_ — `TODO_LINK`

{% callout type="tip" title="Include the human story" %}
Add 2–3 short moments here: a team pivot, an unexpected bug, a “we shipped anyway” decision, or a great collaboration moment.
{% /callout %}

### Winners (optional)

- **1st place**: _[team/project]_ — _[why it won]_
- **2nd place**: _[team/project]_ — _[why it stood out]_
- **Community favorite**: _[team/project]_ — _[why people loved it]_

## Event 2: v0 — Prompt to Production

The second event was focused on a very specific outcome: **turning prompts into a shippable UI and hooking it up to real data**.

### What we covered

- writing prompts that produce **consistent components**
- iterating on UI with **constraints** (design tokens, copy, states)
- moving from generated UI to **maintainable code**
- connecting to real data and shipping a deployable app

### Demo flow (template)

1. **Prompt**: _[include your prompt or a simplified version]_
2. **First pass**: what we got, what was wrong
3. **Second pass**: constraints + state handling + edge cases
4. **Production pass**: types, accessibility, and wiring data

{% card title="Prompt I used (template)" description="Paste your final prompt here when ready." %}
TODO: Paste the final “prompt to production” prompt here.
{% /card %}

## How I organized it (the playbook)

If you want to run a similar weekend, here’s the checklist I used.

### 1) Pre-event (1–2 weeks before)

- **Venue**: confirm capacity, Wi‑Fi, power, projection, check-in flow
- **Registration**: form + waitlist + reminder emails
- **Sponsors (optional)**: prizes, swag, food budget
- **Content**: slides + schedule + judging rubric + demo timer
- **Mentors**: recruit [X] mentors for [X] teams

### 2) Day-of operations

- **Signage**: where to go, Wi‑Fi password, schedule, QR links
- **Roles**:
  - MC / timekeeper (me)
  - check-in + badges
  - mentor wrangler
  - AV support
- **Rituals**:
  - 30-min mentor loops
  - halfway “checkpoint” (teams must have something runnable)
  - demo order + hard demo cutoff

### 3) After-event

- collect project links + photos
- recap post (this one)
- thank-you message to attendees/venue/mentors
- feedback form + “what should we do next?”

## What worked well

- **[thing #1]** — why it worked / what it enabled
- **[thing #2]** — why it worked / what it enabled
- **[thing #3]** — why it worked / what it enabled

## What I’d improve next time

- **[improvement #1]** — what I’d change, and why
- **[improvement #2]** — what I’d change, and why
- **[improvement #3]** — what I’d change, and why

{% callout type="warning" title="The honest part" %}
Write 2–4 sentences about one thing that went wrong (timing, Wi‑Fi, scope, demos) and how you handled it. People trust the post more when it’s real.
{% /callout %}

## Lessons learned (for builders)

- **Keep scope brutally small**: demo-first, polish later
- **Ship a “thin slice”**: one user journey end-to-end
- **Use AI as leverage, not a crutch**: validate outputs, add types/tests where it matters
- **Make the demo story clear**: problem → solution → wow → next steps

## Thank yous

- **Attendees**: for building and helping each other
- **Mentors**: _[names or group]_ for unblocking teams
- **Venue**: _[name]_ for hosting
- **Partners/sponsors**: _[optional]_

## What’s next

- Next event idea: _[workshop / demo night / hackathon #2]_
- Date window: _[month/week]_
- If you want to join: _[link / newsletter / social]_

_If you built something during the weekend, reply with a link to your demo or repo and I’ll add it to the list above._
