# You Can Build Web Apps. Yes, You.

Maybe you're a designer who wants to bring your ideas to life. Maybe you're in marketing and tired of waiting for developers. Or maybe you're just curious about how apps are made.

Good news: you don't need a computer science degree. You don't need to understand everything before you start. You just need to follow along.

{% callout type="info" title="What We'll Do" %}
1. Download an app called **Cursor**
2. Use Cursor's AI assistant to set up everything else
3. Run your first code

That's it. The AI will guide you through any technical stuff.
{% /callout %}

---

# Step 1: Download Cursor

Cursor is like a smart notepad for code. It has an AI assistant built in that can help you write code, explain things, and even run commands for you.

{% card title="Download Cursor" variant="feature" %}
1. Go to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)
2. Click the download button
3. Install it like any other app (drag to Applications on Mac, or run the installer on Windows)
4. Open Cursor
{% /card %}

When you first open Cursor, it might ask you to sign in or create an account. Follow the prompts—it only takes a minute.

---

# Step 2: Meet Your AI Assistant

Once Cursor is open, you'll see a code editor. Don't worry about all the buttons and menus for now.

**Press `Cmd + I` on Mac or `Ctrl + I` on Windows.**

This opens the AI chat. This is your new best friend. You can ask it anything, and it will help you.

{% callout type="tip" title="How This Works" %}
From now on, we'll give you **prompts** to copy and paste into this AI chat. The AI will explain what's happening and run the commands for you. You don't need to memorize anything.
{% /callout %}

---

# Step 3: Let the AI Check Your Computer

Before we install anything, let's see what you already have. Copy this entire prompt and paste it into the Cursor AI chat:

{% card title="Prompt 1: Check My System" variant="feature" %}
```
I'm a complete beginner setting up my computer for web development. I've never used a terminal before.

Please help me check what's already installed on my computer. Run the necessary commands and explain the results in simple terms.

Check for:
1. What operating system I'm using
2. If Node.js is installed (and what version)
3. If NVM is installed
4. If Git is installed

After checking, tell me what we need to install next. Keep your explanation simple - imagine you're talking to someone who has never written code before.
```
{% /card %}

The AI will run some commands and show you the results. Read what it says—it will tell you what's next.

---

# Step 4: Install NVM (Your Version Manager)

NVM is a tool that installs and manages Node.js (which you need to run web applications). Don't worry about what that means yet—just copy this prompt:

{% card title="Prompt 2: Install NVM" variant="feature" %}
```
I need to install NVM (Node Version Manager) on my computer. I'm a complete beginner.

Please:
1. Detect my operating system
2. Give me the exact steps to install NVM
3. If there are commands to run, explain what each one does in plain English before running it
4. After installation, verify it worked

If I'm on Windows, walk me through downloading and installing NVM for Windows step by step.

If I'm on Mac, check if I have Homebrew first. If not, help me install that first.

If I'm on Linux, use the curl installation script.

Go slow and check with me before each major step.
```
{% /card %}

{% callout type="info" title="This Might Take a Few Minutes" %}
The AI might need to install other tools first (like Homebrew on Mac). That's normal. Just follow along with what it tells you.
{% /callout %}

---

# Step 5: Install Node.js

Now that NVM is installed, we can use it to install Node.js. This is what actually runs your web applications.

{% card title="Prompt 3: Install Node.js" variant="feature" %}
```
NVM should now be installed on my computer. Please help me:

1. First, verify that NVM is working (if it's not, help me troubleshoot)
2. Install the latest LTS (stable) version of Node.js using NVM
3. Verify that Node.js and npm are now installed
4. Explain in simple terms what we just installed and why it matters

Remember, I'm a beginner. If something goes wrong, help me fix it step by step.
```
{% /card %}

# Step 6: Create Your First Project

You now have everything you need! Let's create a simple project to make sure it all works.

{% card title="Prompt 4: Create My First Project" variant="feature" %}
```
I want to create my very first web project to test that everything is working.

Please help me:
1. Create a new folder for my project (call it "my-first-app")
2. Set it up as a web project
3. Create a simple file that prints "Hello World!"
4. Run it and show me the result

Explain each step as we go. I want to understand what's happening, not just copy commands.

After it works, suggest one small thing I can change to see how the code works.
```
{% /card %}

{% callout type="success" title="Congratulations!" %}
If you see "Hello World!" in your terminal, you did it! You just ran your first code. Everything from here is just building on what you've learned.
{% /callout %}

---

# What Just Happened?

Let's recap what you installed and why:

| What | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Cursor** | Your code editor with AI assistance |
| **NVM** | Manages different versions of Node.js |
| **Node.js** | Runs JavaScript code outside a browser |
| **npm** | Installs packages (pre-built code you can use) |

You don't need to memorize this. You can always ask the AI to remind you.

# Where to Go From Here

Now that your computer is set up, you can start building real things. Here are some prompts to continue your journey:

{% card title="Prompt: Learn HTML Basics" variant="feature" %}
```
I just set up my development environment and ran my first JavaScript code.

Now I want to learn HTML - the language that creates web pages.

Create a simple HTML file that I can open in my browser. Include:
- A heading with my name
- A paragraph about me
- A picture (you can use a placeholder)

Explain what each part does as you write it.
```
{% /card %}

{% card title="Prompt: Build a Simple Website" variant="feature" %}
```
I know basic HTML now. I want to create a simple personal website with:
- A home page about me
- Nice styling that looks modern
- It should work on phones and computers

Start simple and build up. Explain your choices as you go.
```
{% /card %}

{% card title="Prompt: Understand What I'm Doing" variant="feature" %}
```
I've been following along and running code, but I want to understand it better.

Can you explain like I'm 10 years old:
1. What is a terminal and why do developers use it?
2. What is JavaScript and why is it important?
3. What happens when I type "npm" or "node" commands?
4. How do websites actually work?

Use analogies and simple examples. No jargon.
```
{% /card %}

# Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong, don't panic. Just describe the problem to the AI:

{% card title="Prompt: Help Me Fix This" variant="feature" %}
```
Something went wrong and I got this error:

[Paste your error message here]

I'm a beginner. Please:
1. Explain what this error means in simple terms
2. Tell me why it might have happened
3. Walk me through fixing it step by step
4. Explain how to avoid this in the future
```
{% /card %}

{% callout type="tip" title="Errors Are Normal" %}
Every developer sees errors constantly. It's not a sign that you did something wrong—it's just how computers communicate. The AI can help you understand and fix almost any error.
{% /callout %}

---

# You're Ready

That's it. You have a working development environment, an AI assistant to help you, and prompts to continue learning.

The most important thing to remember: **you don't need to understand everything to get started**. Understanding comes from doing. Keep building small things, keep asking questions, and keep going.

{% card title="One Last Prompt" variant="success" %}
```
I just finished setting up my development environment. I'm excited but also a bit overwhelmed.

Give me a simple 30-day plan to learn web development. Each day should have:
- One small thing to learn (15-30 minutes)
- One tiny project to practice it

Make it achievable for someone with a full-time job. Start very easy and gradually increase difficulty.
```
{% /card %}

Welcome to web development. You've got this.
