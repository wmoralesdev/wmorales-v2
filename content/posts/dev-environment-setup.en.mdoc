# Your First Steps Into Web Development

If you've ever wanted to create websites or web applications but felt intimidated by all the technical jargon, you're in the right place. This guide will walk you through setting up your computer for web development, step by step.

{% callout type="info" title="What We'll Cover" %}
By the end of this guide, you'll have everything you need to start building web applications:
- A **terminal** (command line) ready to use
- **Node.js** installed via NVM (Node Version Manager)
- A **code editor** to write your code
{% /callout %}

## Understanding the Basics

Before we dive in, let's clarify some terms:

- **Terminal / Command Line**: A text-based interface to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking on icons, you type commands.
- **Node.js**: A runtime that allows you to run JavaScript (a programming language) outside of a web browser.
- **NVM (Node Version Manager)**: A tool that lets you install and switch between different versions of Node.js easily.
- **Code Editor**: An application where you write your code, similar to Microsoft Word but for programming.

{% card title="Why NVM?" variant="feature" %}
Using NVM instead of installing Node.js directly gives you:
- Easy version switching between projects
- No permission issues on macOS and Linux
- Clean uninstalls and upgrades
- Better compatibility with different projects
{% /card %}

## Choose Your Operating System

Click on your operating system to see the specific instructions:

---

# macOS Setup

## Step 1: Open Terminal

1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight Search
2. Type `Terminal` and press Enter
3. A window with a command line will open

{% callout type="tip" title="Terminal Tip" %}
You can also find Terminal in **Applications → Utilities → Terminal**
{% /callout %}

## Step 2: Install Homebrew (Package Manager)

Homebrew makes it easy to install software on macOS. Copy and paste this command into Terminal and press Enter:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the on-screen instructions. You may need to enter your Mac password (you won't see characters as you type – that's normal).

## Step 3: Install NVM

Once Homebrew is installed, run:

```bash
brew install nvm
```

After installation, you need to set up NVM. Run these commands one at a time:

```bash
mkdir ~/.nvm
```

Now add NVM to your shell configuration. Run this command:

```bash
echo 'export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Close Terminal and open it again, or run:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Step 4: Install Node.js

Now install the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers printed (e.g., `v20.10.0` and `10.2.0`).

# Linux Setup (Ubuntu/Debian)

## Step 1: Open Terminal

1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open Terminal
2. Or find Terminal in your applications menu

## Step 2: Update Your System

First, update your package list:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 3: Install NVM

Run this command to download and install NVM:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, close and reopen Terminal, or run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify NVM is installed:

```bash
nvm --version
```

## Step 4: Install Node.js

Install the latest LTS version:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

{% callout type="success" title="You're Done!" %}
Your Linux system is now ready for web development!
{% /callout %}

# Windows Setup

Windows requires a few extra steps, but don't worry – we'll guide you through everything.

## Step 1: Install Windows Terminal (Recommended)

1. Open **Microsoft Store** from the Start menu
2. Search for **Windows Terminal**
3. Click **Get** or **Install**

{% callout type="info" title="Alternative: PowerShell" %}
If you don't want to install Windows Terminal, you can use PowerShell. Search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu and right-click to **Run as Administrator**.
{% /callout %}

## Step 2: Install NVM for Windows

NVM for Windows is different from the Unix version but works similarly.

1. Go to [NVM for Windows releases](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
2. Download the latest `nvm-setup.exe` file
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Accept the default options

{% callout type="warning" title="Important" %}
If you have Node.js already installed, the installer will ask if you want NVM to manage it. Select **Yes**.
{% /callout %}

## Step 3: Verify NVM Installation

Open **Windows Terminal** or **PowerShell** and run:

```bash
nvm version
```

You should see a version number.

## Step 4: Install Node.js

Run these commands:

```bash
nvm install lts
nvm use lts
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

# Installing a Code Editor

Now that you have Node.js installed, you need a place to write your code.

## Option 1: Cursor (Recommended for Beginners)

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that helps you write code faster with built-in AI assistance.

1. Go to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)
2. Download the version for your operating system
3. Install and open it

{% card title="Why Cursor?" variant="feature" %}
Cursor is perfect for beginners because:
- Built-in AI can explain code and help you learn
- It can generate code from natural language descriptions
- Excellent autocomplete suggestions
- Based on VS Code, so it's familiar to many developers
{% /card %}

## Option 2: Visual Studio Code

If you prefer a traditional editor without AI features:

1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download the version for your operating system
3. Install and open it

# Testing Your Setup

Let's create a simple project to verify everything works!

## Step 1: Create a Project Folder

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
```

## Step 2: Initialize the Project

```bash
npm init -y
```

This creates a `package.json` file that tracks your project's dependencies.

## Step 3: Create Your First File

In your code editor, create a new file called `index.js` in the `my-first-project` folder with this content:

```javascript
console.log("Hello! Your development environment is working!");
```

## Step 4: Run Your Code

In the terminal, make sure you're in the project folder and run:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see: `Hello! Your development environment is working!`

{% callout type="success" title="Congratulations!" %}
You've successfully set up your development environment and run your first JavaScript code!
{% /callout %}

# Common Issues and Solutions

## "Command not found: nvm"

This usually means NVM isn't loaded in your terminal session.

**macOS/Linux**: Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` and try again.

**Windows**: Close and reopen your terminal.

## "Permission denied" errors

**macOS/Linux**: Don't use `sudo` with npm. If you're getting permission errors, something might be wrong with your NVM installation. Try reinstalling NVM.

**Windows**: Run your terminal as Administrator.

## Node version not switching

Make sure you're using the right command:
- **macOS/Linux**: `nvm use <version>`
- **Windows**: `nvm use <version>` (same command, but requires a full version number like `20.10.0`)

# What's Next?

Now that your environment is ready, here are some paths you can explore:

1. **Learn HTML/CSS**: The building blocks of web pages
2. **Learn JavaScript**: The programming language of the web
3. **Try a Framework**: React, Vue, or Next.js for building modern web apps
4. **Use AI Assistance**: Tools like Cursor can help you learn faster

I'm a complete beginner with no programming experience. I want to learn web development.

Please help me:
1. Create a simple "Hello World" web page with HTML
2. Add some basic CSS styling
3. Explain each line of code as we go

Keep explanations simple and avoid technical jargon. If you must use a technical term, explain what it means in plain English.

After we complete the basic page, suggest a small improvement I can make to practice what I learned.
