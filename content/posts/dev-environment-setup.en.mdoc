# You Can Build Web Apps. Yes, You.

Maybe you're a designer who wants to bring your ideas to life. Maybe you're in marketing and tired of waiting for developers. Or maybe you're just curious about how apps are made.

Good news: you don't need a computer science degree. You don't need to understand everything before you start. You just need to follow along.

{% callout type="info" title="What We'll Do" %}
1. Download an app called **Cursor**
2. Use Cursor's AI assistant to set up everything else
3. Run your first code

That's it. The AI will guide you through any technical stuff.
{% /callout %}

# First, Let's Understand What We're Installing

Before we start downloading things, here's a quick overview of what each tool does. Don't worry about memorizing this—you can always come back to reference it.

{% card title="The Tools We'll Use" variant="feature" %}

| Tool | What It Is | Simple Analogy |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Cursor** | A smart text editor for writing code | Like Microsoft Word, but for code, with an AI assistant built in |
| **Node.js** | A program that runs JavaScript code | Like a translator that turns your code into actions |
| **NVM** | Node Version Manager - installs and manages Node.js | Like an app store specifically for Node.js versions |
| **npm** | Node Package Manager - comes with Node.js | Like a library where you can borrow pre-built code |
| **Git** | Tracks changes to your code | Like "Track Changes" in Word, but more powerful |

{% /card %}

{% callout type="tip" title="Why These Specific Tools?" %}
These are the standard tools used by millions of web developers. Once you learn them, you can work on almost any web project and understand tutorials across the internet.
{% /callout %}

---

# Step 1: Download and Install Cursor

Let's start with the easiest part—downloading Cursor. It's just like installing any other app on your computer.

## What is Cursor?

**Cursor** is a code editor with an AI assistant built right in. Think of it as a smart notepad where you write code, and you have an AI friend sitting next to you who can:

- Write code for you based on what you describe
- Explain any code you don't understand
- Run commands on your computer
- Fix errors and debug problems
- Answer any questions you have

{% card title="Download Cursor" variant="feature" %}
1. Go to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)
2. Click the download button for your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
3. **On Mac**: Open the downloaded file and drag Cursor to your Applications folder
4. **On Windows**: Run the installer and follow the prompts (click "Next" a few times)
5. Open Cursor
{% /card %}

When you first open Cursor, it will ask you to sign in or create an account. This only takes a minute—you can use your Google or GitHub account, or create a new one with your email.

---

# Step 2: Getting to Know Cursor's Interface

Before we start installing other tools, let's take a quick tour of Cursor so you know where things are.

{% callout type="info" title="Don't Worry About Memorizing" %}
You don't need to remember all of this right now. Just get a general sense of the layout. You'll become familiar with it naturally as you use it.
{% /callout %}

## The Main Areas

When you open Cursor, you'll see something like this:

**Left Side: File Explorer**
- Shows all the files and folders in your project
- Like the folder view in Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows)

**Center: Editor**
- Where you write and edit code
- Can have multiple files open in tabs, like a web browser

**Bottom: Terminal**
- A text-based way to interact with your computer
- This is where commands run (don't worry, the AI will help you with this)
- If you don't see it, press `` Ctrl + ` `` (the backtick key, usually above Tab)

**Right Side: AI Chat (when open)**
- Your AI assistant lives here
- Open it with `Cmd + I` (Mac) or `Ctrl + I` (Windows)

## The Most Important Shortcut

The only shortcut you really need to remember right now:

**`Cmd + I` (Mac) or `Ctrl + I` (Windows)** — Opens the AI chat

This is your lifeline. Whenever you're stuck or don't know what to do, open the AI chat and ask.

---

# Step 3: Let the AI Check Your Computer

Now let's use Cursor's AI to see what's already installed on your computer. This is where the magic happens—instead of typing mysterious commands yourself, you'll just ask the AI to do it.

**Open the AI chat** by pressing `Cmd + I` (Mac) or `Ctrl + I` (Windows).

Then click the button below to open this prompt directly in Cursor, or copy and paste it into the chat:

{% cursor-prompt title="Prompt 1: Check My System" prompt="I'm a complete beginner setting up my computer for web development. I've never used a terminal before.

Please help me check what's already installed on my computer. Run the necessary commands and explain the results in simple terms.

Check for:
1. What operating system I'm using
2. If Node.js is installed (and what version)
3. If NVM is installed
4. If Git is installed

After checking, tell me what we need to install next. Keep your explanation simple - imagine you're talking to someone who has never written code before." /%}

{% callout type="tip" title="What's Happening?" %}
When you send this prompt, the AI will run some commands in the terminal (the text area at the bottom of Cursor). It's looking at your system to see what's already there. Read what it tells you—it will explain what it found and what to do next.
{% /callout %}

---

# Step 4: Install NVM

NVM (Node Version Manager) is a tool that makes it easy to install Node.js. Why use NVM instead of installing Node.js directly? Because:

- It's easier to update Node.js later
- You can switch between different versions if needed
- It avoids permission problems that can happen with direct installation

{% cursor-prompt title="Prompt 2: Install NVM" prompt="I need to install NVM (Node Version Manager) on my computer. I'm a complete beginner.

Please:
1. Detect my operating system
2. Give me the exact steps to install NVM
3. If there are commands to run, explain what each one does in plain English before running it
4. After installation, verify it worked

If I'm on Windows, walk me through downloading and installing NVM for Windows step by step.

If I'm on Mac, check if I have Homebrew first. If not, help me install that first, then install NVM.

If I'm on Linux, use the curl installation script.

Go slow and check with me before each major step." /%}

{% callout type="info" title="This Might Take a Few Minutes" %}
Depending on your operating system, the AI might need to install some prerequisites first (like Homebrew on Mac). This is normal—just follow along with what it tells you. If it asks you to close and reopen Cursor (or the terminal), do that and then continue.
{% /callout %}

---

# Step 5: Install Node.js

Now that NVM is installed, we can use it to install Node.js. Node.js is what actually runs your web applications—it's the engine that makes everything work.

{% cursor-prompt title="Prompt 3: Install Node.js" prompt="NVM should now be installed on my computer. Please help me:

1. First, verify that NVM is working (if it's not, help me troubleshoot)
2. Install the latest LTS (stable) version of Node.js using NVM
3. Verify that Node.js and npm are now installed
4. Explain in simple terms what we just installed and why it matters

Remember, I'm a beginner. If something goes wrong, help me fix it step by step." /%}

{% callout type="success" title="What is LTS?" %}
LTS stands for "Long Term Support." It's the most stable, reliable version of Node.js—the one recommended for most people. New features come out in other versions first, but LTS is tested and trusted.
{% /callout %}

---

# Step 6: Create Your First Project

You now have everything you need installed! Let's create a simple project to make sure it all works—and to give you the satisfaction of running your first code.

{% cursor-prompt title="Prompt 4: Create My First Project" prompt="I want to create my very first web project to test that everything is working.

Please help me:
1. Create a new folder for my project (call it 'my-first-app')
2. Set it up as a web project with npm
3. Create a simple file that prints 'Hello World!'
4. Run it and show me the result

Explain each step as we go. I want to understand what's happening, not just copy commands.

After it works, suggest one small thing I can change to see how the code responds to changes." /%}

{% callout type="success" title="You Did It!" %}
If you see "Hello World!" in your terminal, congratulations! You just ran your first code. Everything from here is just building on what you've already done.
{% /callout %}

# What Did We Just Install?

Let's recap what's now on your computer and why each piece matters:

{% card title="Your New Toolkit" variant="feature" %}

**Cursor** — Your home base. This is where you'll write code, ask the AI for help, and run commands. You'll spend most of your time here.

**NVM** — The installer for Node.js. You probably won't interact with it much after today, but it's there when you need to update Node.js or switch versions.

**Node.js** — The engine that runs JavaScript code. When you build web apps, Node.js is what makes them work. It's running behind the scenes.

**npm** — Came bundled with Node.js. This lets you download and use code that other people have written—like building blocks you can snap together.

{% /card %}

# Where to Go From Here

Your computer is now set up for web development. Here are some project starters to build real apps—just like tools like Lovable or v0, but right here in Cursor:

{% cursor-prompt title="React + Vite + shadcn web app" prompt="I'm a complete beginner with no technical background. I just set up my development environment and I want to build a modern web app.

Please help me create a React application using Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn/ui. I want to build a simple task manager where I can:

# Troubleshooting

Things don't always go perfectly—that's normal in programming. If you hit a problem, describe it to the AI:

{% cursor-prompt title="Help Me Fix This" prompt="Something went wrong and I got this error:

[PASTE YOUR ERROR MESSAGE HERE]

I'm a beginner. Please:
1. Explain what this error means in simple terms
2. Tell me why it might have happened
3. Walk me through fixing it step by step
4. Explain how to avoid this in the future" /%}

{% callout type="tip" title="Errors Are Normal" %}
Every developer—even experts with decades of experience—sees errors constantly. Errors aren't a sign that you did something wrong; they're just how computers communicate problems. The AI can help you understand and fix almost any error you encounter.
{% /callout %}
