# Events System Implementation

## 🎉 Complete Events System with QR Code Scanning & Real-time Galleries

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive events system that allows users to scan QR codes and upload 10-15 photos to Supabase storage with real-time gallery updates.

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 🎯 Core Functionality

- **QR Code Scanning**: Users can scan QR codes to access event galleries
- **Real-time Gallery**: Live updates when users upload photos using Supabase channels
- **Image Upload**: Upload up to 15 photos per event with captions
- **Supabase Storage**: Secure image storage with automatic cleanup
- **User Management**: Track user uploads and prevent abuse
- **Event Management**: Create and manage events with expiration dates

### 📱 User Experience

- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile QR code scanning
- **Real-time Updates**: See new photos as they're uploaded
- **Image Preview**: Click images to view full-size with captions
- **Upload Progress**: Visual feedback during image uploads
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and validation

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema

```prisma
model Event {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  title       String
  description String?
  qrCode      String   @unique @default(cuid())
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  maxImages   Int      @default(15)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  endsAt      DateTime?

  images EventImage[]
}

model EventImage {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  eventId   String
  profileId String
  imageUrl  String
  caption   String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  event Event @relation(fields: [eventId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm add @yudiel/react-qr-scanner html5-qrcode qrcode
```

### 2. Database Setup

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
pnpm prisma:generate

# Run migrations (when database is available)
pnpm prisma:migrate

# Seed with sample events
pnpm prisma:seed:events
```

### 3. Supabase Storage Setup

Create a storage bucket named `event-images` with appropriate policies for authenticated uploads and public reads.

### 4. Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
DIRECT_URL=your_direct_database_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
